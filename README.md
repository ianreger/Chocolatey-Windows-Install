# Chocolatey-Windows-Install

These are the main Chocolatey packages I use when setting up a new PC or am reimaging my own PC. 

## Prerequisites 
Before running  Chocolatey-Windows-Install.ps1, please go to [the Chocolatey install page](https://chocolatey.org/install) and follow the steps there in Powershell as Admin. Give that a few moments to run, then run the Chocolatey-Windows-Install.ps1 file in Powershell as Admin. 

This process can take a bit of time if your internet speed is slow, but this will save the hassle of trying to find the download link for every piece of software you use.
